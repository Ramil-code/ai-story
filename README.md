## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **AWS CLI** (configured with access keys):  
   [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **AWS SAM CLI:**  
   [Install SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)
   ```bash
   sam --version
   ```

3. **Node.js and npm:**  
   [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Backend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ramil-code/ai-story
   ```
3. Upload the  [Lambda ZIP file](https://github.com/Ramil-code/ai-story/blob/1f3c32f405cacb0eecb56c148d75e4e506eb1902/app.py.zip)  to an S3 bucket:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp app.py.zip s3://your-bucket-name/app.py.zip
   ```
4. Update the `CodeUri` line in [`template.yaml`](https://github.com/Ramil-code/ai-story/blob/main/Template.yaml) to reflect the new S3 location:
   ```yaml
   CodeUri: s3://your-bucket-name/app.py.zip
   ```

2. Build and deploy the backend:
   ```bash
   sam build
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

3. After deployment, note the generated API Gateway URL:
   ```
   Outputs:
   ApiUrl - https://xyz123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/generate
   ```

4. Test the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://xyz123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/generate \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"prompt": "Tell me a story", "desiredDuration": 60}'
   ```

---

### Step 2: Deploy the Frontend

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Update the `REPLACE BY YOUR API` line in [`AudioGenerator.txs`](https://github.com/Ramil-code/ai-story/blob/main/src/components/AudioGenerator.tsx) with endpoint link from Step 1.3

3. Run the frontend locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. AWS SAM creates an S3 bucket named `{AWS::StackName}-audio-files`. Update the deployed Lambda code to reference this bucket.
   
5. Go to the S3 console, open the created bucket, enable static website hosting, and configure [access policies](https://github.com/Ramil-code/ai-story/blob/main/s3_policy) to allow public access.
   
6. After Step 2.3, a folder named "dist" will appear in the project directory. Upload its contents to the S3 bucket and retrieve the public URL of the project from the bucket properties.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication using AWS Cognito.
- Implement better UI/UX with Tailwind and React Query.
- Automate deployment using GitHub Actions.
